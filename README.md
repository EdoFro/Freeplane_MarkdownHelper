# Markdown Helper Add On for Freeplane

-----

Welcome to the **alpha** version of the **Markdown Helper AddOn** for **Freeplane**.

This Add On is a tool to create markdown documents in a Freeplane mindmapping way.

More information, instructions and examples in the [Markdown Helper **wiki**](https://github.com/EdoFro/Freeplane_MarkdownHelper/wiki) page.

# How it works

-----

The general idea of this AddOn is to insert **special nodes** in your map that help to **translate** the information in a mindmap **into a Markdown** document.

Here you can see an example where a **paragraph** is **combined with** nodes with links to **images** and **webpages** into a Markdown formatted text.

You obtain a good looking document retaining the **flexibility** that offers Freeplane and Mindmapping. You can easy reorder and insert new ideas as usual.

# This AddOn is still beta

-----

So it may have a lot of bugs. Use it at your own risk. (**Freeplane** has an excelent "*Undo*" implementation, so the risk is in fact very limited)

Please report any bug in this addOn in its GitHub page
