# My Document

## Introduction

This is just a test

I don`t have much more to say

## Chapter 1

The details of this node are included as first paragraph under the header.

This header node has a note and it will be included in the final document after the details of this node and before the text in the children nodes.

... and the final sentence of this chapter.

## Chapter 2

Blah  blah blah blablah blablablah blah blablah, Blablablah  blablablah blablablah **blablah** blablah **blablablablah**.

 Blablablah  blablah blablah **blablah** blablah blablablah blablablablah.

## Conclussions

This is the text that is written in the note of the last node in this example branch.
