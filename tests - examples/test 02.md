## 2. Story Arcs

-----

In [Calvin and Hobbes](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes), story arcs are a theme or plotline that lasts longer than a day. They can range from a few days to a month, such as the arc with [Calvin](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvin) accidentally pushing [his parents' car](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Car) into a ditch.

Generally, the strip had week-long story arcs for the first couple of years and had its longest arcs in the middle of the its life. Later on, the arcs became fewer and farther between as [Bill Watterson](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Bill_Watterson) focused more on [Sunday strips](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Sunday_comics).



Story arcs are used mainly to develop characters, introduce new devices, or investigate new artistic directions.

## 4. Watterson

-----

William Boyd "Bill" Watterson II (born July 5, 1958) is the author of [Calvin and Hobbes](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes). He was author and artist during the strip's decade-long run. Calvin and Hobbes abruptly ceased publication in 1995, when Watterson decided to retire. He is now removed completely from the public eye, and is reluctant to take interviews, preferring to let his work speak for itself. He drew Calvin's father to look exactly like himself, for symbolism. Bill is currently 62 years old.



## 5. Books

-----

Despite [ Bill Watterson](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Bill_Watterson)'s reluctance to sell [merchandise](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Licensing) based on [merchandise](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Licensing) or its characters, he still allowed some merchandise to reach the public, one of the few was books. There have so far been eighteen books (including one three-volume set) published in the United States.

The books, referred to as "Collections", form a complete archive of the newspaper strips, except for a [single daily strip](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_strip) from November 28, 1985 (The collections do contain a strip for this date, but it is not the same strip that appeared in some newspapers). "Treasuries" combine the two preceding collections with bonus material and include color reprints of Sunday comics, and irregular printed collections reprint already published comics with a particular intent, such as providing original sketches or commentary.

A complete collection of Calvin and Hobbes strips, in three hardcover volumes, with a total 1440 pages, was released on October 4, 2005, by [Andrews & McMeel](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Andrews_%26_McMeel) Publishing. It also includes color prints of the art used on paperback covers, the Treasuries' extra illustrated stories and poems, and an original 14-page introduction by Bill Watterson. Unfortunately, the alternate 1985 strip is still omitted, and two other strips (January 7, 1987, and November 25, 1988) have altered dialogue.

To celebrate the release, Calvin and Hobbes reruns were made available to newspapers from Sunday, September 4, 2005, through Saturday, December 31, 2005, and Bill Watterson answered a select dozen questions submitted by readers. ([[1]](http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/features/thereturn/) [[2]](http://www.andrewsmcmeel.com/calvinandhobbes/returning.html)) Like current contemporary strips, weekday Calvin and Hobbes strips now appear in color print when available, instead of black and white as in their first run.

Early books were printed in a smaller format, and the Sunday strips appeared in black and white. They were then reprinted, in color for the Sundays, in the three "Treasuries" (Essential, Authoritative, and Indispensable). The contents of Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons were not reprinted, and its Sunday comics were in black and white. As a result, those Sunday strips were never reprinted in color until the Complete collection was published in 2005. Every book since Snow Goons had been printed in a larger format with Sundays in color and weekday and Saturday strips larger than they appeared in most newspapers.

Remaining books do contain some additional content; for instance, The Calvin and Hobbes Lazy Sunday Book contains a long watercolor Spaceman Spiff epic not seen elsewhere until Complete, and The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book contains much original commentary from Watterson. Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985-1995 contains 36 Sunday strips in color alongside Watterson's original sketches, prepared for an exhibition at The Ohio State University Cartoon Research Library.

An officially licensed children's textbook entitled [Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Teaching_with_Calvin_and_Hobbes) ([ISBN 1878849158](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/ISBN_1878849158?action=edit&redlink=1)) was published in 1993. It reprints 57 comic strips comprising 5 [story arcs](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Story_arcs).
